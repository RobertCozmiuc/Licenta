-Interface is the interface of the project and it connects to the database 'jERtaPoJ1f' to get the extract the data when an user acceses it.
-jERtaPoJ1f is the database that contains all the needed information that I predicted about the upcoming eclipses, like the date that they will ocour and the latitude and logitude where the central point of the eclipse will be visible
-predicting-date is the program that uses a machine learning algorithm to predict the date
-predicting-location is the program that uses a machine learning algorithm to predict the location
-solar is the .csv file that contains all the information provided by NASA about the past eclipses that ocourd in the past +3000 years
